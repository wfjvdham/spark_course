# About Spark

[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)

- **Scalability** Spark scales horizontally, allowing users to easily scale their applications from a single machine to thousands of nodes. It achieves scalability by distributing data across the cluster and parallelizing computation.
- **Lazy Evaluation** Spark adopts a lazy evaluation strategy, meaning it delays executing transformations until an action is triggered. This optimization technique improves performance by allowing Spark to optimize the execution.
- **In-Memory Computing** Spark's in-memory computing capabilities enable it to cache frequently accessed data in memory, which significantly accelerates iterative algorithms and interactive data analysis.
- **Ease of Use** Spark provides high-level APIs in languages like Scala, Java, Python, and R, making it accessible to a wide range of developers with different skill sets. It also offers a rich set of built-in libraries for various tasks like SQL queries (Spark SQL), machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and stream processing (Spark Streaming).
